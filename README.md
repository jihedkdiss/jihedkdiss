🛡️ I am a security researcher with over 4 years of experience, specializing in reverse engineering and malware analysis. Currently, I work at Securinets as a Capture The Flag (CTF) author and instructor.

💼 Previously, I was a cybersecurity instructor at Internews and a System Administrator at Radio Mednine. I also teach programming and hacking at Blade Club (@bladeclub.tn).

🏫 I am studying Software Engineering at INSAT, where I focus on topics such as computer architecture, algorithms, and my favorite: low-level programming.
